# Kissanime-Downloader
Mandatory: Kissanime account (you can make a throwaway if you would like) as the program requires it. As well as Chrome, and .Net framework (the version I did it with as 4.5.2)

Note: Using ".io" is currently bugged, please use ".ru". I wouldn't recommend downloading shows that have more than 20-30 episodes for right now, I'm thinking up to 10 might be the best bet (thinking I'm going to make it do 5 at a time). There are also a few more planned features.

How to use:

Step 1: Enter your username.

Step 2: Enter your password. (The box to the right of the password field it to show the password in plain text.)

Step 3: Either type, or copy and paste in the anime's url (ex. "http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Mob-Psycho-100-Dub")

Step 4: Quality selection. Type 1 for best, 2 for second best, 3 for worse, 4 for worst. Then hit enter. (Note: if a video actually has 5 it won't actually be worst. And if a video ONLY has 1080 it will download that version no matter the quality selection. 4 may end up using 320x180, so use 3 if you don't want it to look like complete garbage.)

Step 5: Click the "Get Episodes" button then wait.

Step 6: Select the episodes you want. Click the "âˆš" button to select all, and the "x" button to unselect all.

Step 7: Click "Download Episodes" (Note: there is a possiblity it will ask if you are a robot. Though I added a delay on requesting pages, so it hopefully won't pop up.)

Step 8: Sit back and enjoy!
