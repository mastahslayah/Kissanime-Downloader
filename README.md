# Kissanime-Downloader
Mandatory: Kissanime account (you can make a throwaway if you would like) as the program requires it. As well as Chrome, and .Net framework (the version I did it with as 4.5.2)

Note: Several things are on the TODO list, however it still works in its current state.






How to use:

Step 1: Type username then hit enter.

Step 2: Type password then hit enter.

Step 3: Either type, or copy and paste in the anime's url (ex. "http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Mob-Psycho-100-Dub")

Step 4: Quality selection. Type 1 for best, 2 for second best, 3 for worse, 4 for worst. Then hit enter. (Note: if a video actually has 5 it won't actually be worst. And if a video ONLY has 1080 it will download that version no matter the quality selection. 4 may end up using 320x180, so use 3 if you don't want it to look like complete garbage.)

Step 5: Sit back and wait!
